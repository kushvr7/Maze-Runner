    <td> This is the glimpes of the project . <br/>
   It is developed using <b>react js</b> , <br/>which is a library of a <b>js</b> (javascript) .
   <b>EXTRA PACKAGES USED ARE :</b>
   <ul>
   <b><li>Radium</li></b>
   <b><li>ReactBootstrap</li></b>
   <b><li>Google Fonts</li></b>
   <b><li>Gh-Pages</li></b>
   </ul>
    
   If you are into programming then you will surely like the
   implementation of Graph Theory in practical use .

  <td>In this project both of the Graph Traversal are used i.e. <b>BFS (Breadth-First Search)</b> and <b>DFS (Depth-First Search)</b><br/><br/>
   BFS is used to traverse the path to reach the Destination in shortest path Possible .<br/><br/>
   DFS is used to go in depth so as to backtrack and get the co-ordinates of the path to display it

  ### `Instructions :`
  
  BFS & DFS Algorithm used in the Project as major backbone <br/><br/>
          
  <b>RED</b> are the Obstacles dynamically created<br/>
  <b>BLUE</b> is the Start self choosen<br/>
  <b>GREEN</b>  is the Exit self choosen <br/>
  <b>GREY</b> : is the Traversed path by the algorithm <br/>
             
 Firstly provide the size of maze in Ro</span> input field above and start .  Place every required component as per your choice . After placing entry , exit and hurdles press button <b><i>( Search )</i></b>.
 It will traverse the provided grid and eventually result into the Path to exit and hence the Maze will be solved with the path shown in <i>GOLD<i>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `Procedures to follow :`
  <ol>
  <li>Search for you <b>State</b> in the input field given at the top .</li><br/>
  <li><b>Double click</b> to get the map of the searched state .</li><br/>
  <li><b>Scroll down</b> to get the information of your district through the table .</li><br/>
  <li>If any new case found in your district the it will be represented with the respected colours i.e. green , red , blue and white</li><br/>
  </ul>
